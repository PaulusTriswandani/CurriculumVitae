* Little intro about me

- Born with asian culture in an Islamic Country (Indonesia)
- Always ranked 2nd at elementary school (I'm not bright enough to be the 1st)
- When things got more difficult at junior school and high school I still made it to the top 10, but never made it to the first
- In College, I once again ranked 2nd from the graduates at my year
- Go to China for study, got messed up by hustlers and go back to Indonesia and got messed up again, but now by terrorists
- Trying to tidy up my life by doing something I'm good at which is studying
- [[./cv.slide][Complete Story]]

* What next
- Study something
- Build something
- Evaluate something

* Study something
- my skill right now consists of :
	- language : Indonesia, English, Chinese, Japanese
	- programming language : c, c++, go/golang, php, java, javascript, python, flutter
	- cloud : Google Cloud Platform, kubernetes, docker
- planning to further my study on these things, because I just know the skin of it and maybe add :
	- Amazon Web Service
	- functional programming

* Build something
- my imagination is not really bright right now, but I think I want to build something with websocket and video, kind of copying the youtuber [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV0qA-eDDICsRR9rPcnG7tw][Joma Tech]], but maybe using another language. I'm thinking something like golang would be nice.
- I kind of inspired by biography and autobiography books I read nowadays and planning to interview people for their stories and put them on github, but because I cannot write a good story maybe the format would be like this.

* History

- My mother handphone bootlooped
- I flashed it with global rom through PC, result was bricked
- Checked the phone through PC, status is Emergency Download Mode 9008 (EDL Mode 9008)
- try many things, nothing worked
- latest effort, use Xiaomi Tools (XMT), got bricked even worse, now the status is not able to connect to the phone
- status now, regretfully study more with low morale

* Lesson Learned
- Don't be lazy, study more
- More is less pain (at least to my morale)

* First Things First, Bootlooped
What happened after bootlooped?

* What I did after bootlooped?
- check the internet about how to get out of bootlooped
- I found out that to get out of bootloop I need to install something called ROM
- I search for the default ROM and found global MiUI ROM
- turn out it doesn't work, and I make it worse, it became EDL Mode 9008
- I try many things again and it got worse again, cannot read the device anymore
